## Traffic Monetization

When there is a certain amount of SEO traffic(such as monthly PV reaching 10,000), how to monetize SEO traffic becomes a more important topic. Gernerally speaking, we can integrate [Internet Advertising](https://www.bmpi.dev/dev/what-is-internet-advertising/) through advertising platforms such as Google Adsense.
This CPM/CPC is generally not high. The Advertising CPM/CPC depends on the content/region of website. The CPM/CPC range of different content ads is between $0.3-$2.0/$0.2-$15.

![](https://img.bmpi.dev/91bc8569-0fdc-ea98-478e-33d63205f340.png)

The purpose of the traffic site is to improve [RPM](https://tg.bmpi.dev/web_cpc/420.html). In addition to advertising, the website can also access Affiliate and sell products(members, courses) to increase RPM.
